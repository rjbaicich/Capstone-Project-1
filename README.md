Shark Attacks in Coastal Waters - Capstone Project 1
Author: Randy Baicich

Introduction:

Sharks are often perceived as man-eating monsters, but in reality, understanding the risks associated with coastal water activities and improving shark-human relations is crucial. This project aims to analyze the Shark Attack dataset to gain insights into factors contributing to shark attacks and fatalities. By examining the dataset, we can challenge common misconceptions and provide valuable information to promote informed decision-making and enhance public awareness.

Dataset:

The dataset used in this project was originally collected from the Global Shark Attack file, available on the Shark Research Institute's website.https://www.sharkattackfile.net. It can be downloaded from Kaggle's Shark Attack Dataset repository.https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/shark-attacks-the-risks-of-coastal-water-activit. The dataset provides comprehensive information about shark attacks worldwide, including details such as the date, location, activity, species involved, and outcome of the attacks.The groundbreaking findings on shark behavior are credited to the Shark Research Institute, leading to a deeper understanding of these magnificent creatures.

Objectives:

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:
Import the necessary libraries and modules for data processing and analysis.
Tidy the dataset by organizing and cleaning the data to ensure it is in a suitable format for analysis.
Perform data transformation, including calculations of relevant statistics and creation of new features.
Connect to an ElephantSQL instance to perform queries using the created tables.
Visualize the data through various charts, graphs, and visual representations.
Utilize Tableau for further exploration of relationships between different variables.
Communicate the findings and insights obtained from the analysis, including key summaries, visualizations, interpretations, and recommendations.


Hypothesis:

Based on initial observations and assumptions, the following hypotheses are proposed:
A select few shark species will be responsible for the majority of shark attacks and fatalities, rather than a wide variety of species.
The majority of shark attacks will occur at specific times, indicating a temporal pattern in shark-human interactions.
The objective is to test these hypotheses and gain deeper insights into the key factors influencing shark attacks and fatalities.

Conclusion:

This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the Shark Attack dataset, challenging common misconceptions and providing valuable insights into shark attacks in coastal waters. By examining the dataset, performing statistical analysis, and visualizing the data, we can contribute to a better understanding of shark-human interactions and promote informed decision-making for coastal water activities.

Through this analysis, I hope to enhance public awareness, foster better shark-human relations, and ultimately reduce the risks associated with shark attacks.
